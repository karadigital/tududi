## Step 3: Get to Know the Interface

Tududi's interface has three main areas:

### The Sidebar (Left)

This is your main navigation. You'll see:

- **Today** — Your daily dashboard and focus area
- **Upcoming** — Tasks coming up in the near future
- **Calendar** — A visual calendar of your tasks
- **All Tasks** — Every task across all projects

Below that, you'll find sections for:

- **Projects** — Your pinned and recent projects
- **Workspaces** — Organizational groupings
- **Areas** — Department-level groupings (e.g., Marketing, Engineering)
- **Habits** — Habit tracking

At the bottom of the sidebar:

- **+ Create New** — A quick-action button to create a Task, Project, or Area
- **Dark mode toggle** — Switch appearance on the fly
- **Version number** — Shows the current Tududi version

### The Main Content Area (Center)

This is where your tasks, projects, and other content appear. It changes based on what you select in the sidebar.

### Task Details Panel (Right)

When you click on a task, a detail panel opens showing all its information — description, due date, priority, tags, subtasks, and more.

## Step 4: Create Your First Task

Let's create a task to get familiar with the workflow.

### Option A: Quick Add (Fastest)

1. Click **Today** in the sidebar to go to your dashboard
2. Find the **"+ Add new task"** input field at the top of the page
3. Type a task name, such as "Complete Tududi onboarding tutorials"
4. Press **Enter** — your task is created!

### Option B: Full Task Modal (More Detail)

1. Click the **+ Create New** button at the bottom of the sidebar
2. Select **Task** (or use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+T**)
3. A task creation modal opens with these fields:
   - **Task Name** (required) — Give your task a clear, descriptive name
   - **Priority** — Choose from No Priority, Low, Medium, or High
   - **Due Date** — When should this be done?
   - **Project** — Assign it to a project (skip this for now)
   - **Tags** — Add labels for organization (skip this for now)
4. Click **Save**

Your first task now appears in your task list.

## Step 5: Complete Your First Task

Now let's mark it as done:

1. Find the task you just created
2. Click the **checkbox** to the left of the task name
3. The task is marked as complete with a strikethrough

That's it — you've just completed your first task in Tududi.

## Step 6: Explore the Today Dashboard

The **Today** view is your home base. Here's what you'll find:

### Progress Bar

At the top, a progress bar shows how many of today's tasks you've completed. As you check off tasks throughout the day, this fills up.

### Task Sections

Your tasks are organized into collapsible sections:

- **Overdue** — Tasks that are past their due date (address these first!)
- **Due Today** — Tasks due on the current day
- **Today Plan** — Tasks you've manually flagged for today's focus
- **Completed** — Tasks you've finished today

Click the section headers to expand or collapse them.

### Dashboard Widgets

Depending on your settings, you may also see:

- **Weekly Completion Chart** — A visual of your task completions over the week
- **Daily Quote** — A motivational quote to start your day
- **Metrics Dashboard** — Statistics about your task completion rates
- **Next Task Suggestion** — An AI-powered recommendation for what to work on next

You can customize which widgets appear by clicking the **gear icon** at the top of the Today view.
