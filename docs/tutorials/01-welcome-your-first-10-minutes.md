## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Log in and set up your profile
- Navigate the main interface
- Create and complete your first task
- Understand the Today dashboard

---

## Step 1: Log In

Your administrator has created an account for you. Navigate to your company's Tududi URL and log in with the credentials provided to you.

If this is your first time logging in, you may be prompted to verify your email address. Check your inbox for a verification link and click it to activate your account.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Profile

Before diving in, take a moment to personalize your experience. This step is optional but recommended — you can always return to these settings later.

Click on your **profile picture** (or your initials, if you haven't uploaded a photo yet) at the very bottom of the left sidebar. Then select **Profile Settings**.

You'll see a settings page with several tabs. Focus on the **General** tab for now:

### Name & Avatar

- Enter your **Name** and **Surname** so your colleagues can identify you
- Upload a **profile photo** by clicking the photo icon on your avatar (max 5MB)

### Appearance

- Choose between **Light** mode (bright background) and **Dark** mode (dark background) using the sun/moon toggle buttons
- Light mode works well in bright offices; Dark mode is easier on the eyes in dim environments. You can change this anytime

### Language

- Select your preferred language from the dropdown — Tududi supports 24 languages

### Timezone

- Set your **Timezone** so that due dates and reminders appear at the correct local time
- Browse by region to find yours

### First Day of Week

- Choose whether your calendar week starts on **Sunday** or **Monday**

Click **Save** when you're done.

## Step 3: Get to Know the Interface

Tududi's interface has three main areas:

### The Sidebar (Left)

This is your main navigation. You'll see:

- **Today** — Your daily dashboard and focus area
- **Upcoming** — Tasks coming up in the near future
- **Calendar** — A visual calendar of your tasks
- **All Tasks** — Every task across all projects

Below that, you'll find sections for:

- **Projects** — Your pinned and recent projects
- **Workspaces** — Organizational groupings
- **Areas** — Department-level groupings (e.g., Marketing, Engineering)
- **Habits** — Habit tracking

At the bottom of the sidebar:

- **+ Create New** — A quick-action button to create a Task, Project, or Area
- **Dark mode toggle** — Switch appearance on the fly
- **Version number** — Shows the current Tududi version

### The Main Content Area (Center)

This is where your tasks, projects, and other content appear. It changes based on what you select in the sidebar.

### Task Details (Right)

When you click on a task, a detail panel opens on the right side of the screen showing all of the task's information — description, due date, priority, tags, subtasks, and more. This is where you'll edit and manage individual tasks.

## Step 4: Create Your First Task

Let's create a task to get familiar with the workflow.

### Option A: Quick Add (Fastest)

1. Click **Today** in the sidebar to go to your dashboard
2. Find the **"+ Add new task"** input field at the top of the page
3. Type a task name, such as "Complete Tududi onboarding tutorials"
4. Press **Enter** — your task is created!

### Option B: Full Task Modal (More Detail)

1. Click the **+ Create New** button at the bottom of the left sidebar
2. Select **Task** from the menu (or use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+T** on Windows, **Cmd+Shift+T** on Mac)
3. A pop-up form opens with these fields:
   - **Task Name** (required) — Give your task a clear, descriptive name
   - **Priority** — Choose from No Priority, Low, Medium, or High
   - **Due Date** — When should this be done?
   - **Project** — Assign it to a project (skip this for now)
   - **Tags** — Add labels for organization (skip this for now)
4. Click **Save**

Your first task now appears in your task list.

---

## Step 5: Complete Your First Task

Now let's mark it as done:

1. Find the task you just created
2. Click the **checkbox** to the left of the task name
3. The task is marked as complete with a strikethrough

That's it — you've just completed your first task in Tududi.

## Step 6: Explore the Today Dashboard

The **Today** view is your home base. Here's what you'll find:

### Progress Bar

At the top, a progress bar shows how many of today's tasks you've completed. As you check off tasks throughout the day, this fills up.

### Task Sections

Your tasks are organized into collapsible sections:

- **Overdue** — Tasks that are past their due date (address these first!)
- **Due Today** — Tasks due on the current day
- **Today Plan** — Tasks you've manually flagged for today's focus
- **Completed** — Tasks you've finished today

Click the section headers to expand or collapse them.

### Dashboard Extras

Depending on how your admin has configured Tududi, you may also see some of these optional sections. Don't worry if some are missing — they may not be enabled for your account:

- **Weekly Completion Chart** — A visual graph of how many tasks you completed each day this week
- **Daily Quote** — A motivational quote to start your day
- **Metrics Dashboard** — Numbers showing your task completion rates and trends
- **Next Task Suggestion** — A recommendation for what to work on next, based on your priorities and due dates

You can show or hide these sections by clicking the **gear icon** (settings) in the top-right area of the Today view.
