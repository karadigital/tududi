**Audience:** All staff (power users)
**When:** First month
**Time to complete:** 10 minutes

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Create custom filtered views of your tasks
- Save and name views for quick access
- Pin your most-used views to the sidebar
- Build views for common work scenarios
- Use search within views

---

## What Are Views?

Views are **saved filter combinations**. Instead of manually filtering your task list every time you want to see "high priority tasks due this week," you save that filter as a View and access it with a single click.

Think of them as **bookmarks for task queries**.

---

## Creating Your First View

### Step 1: Apply Filters

1. Navigate to the **Views** section
2. Create a new view
3. Configure the filters you want:

**Available Filters:**

| Filter | Options | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Priority** | No Priority, Low, Medium, High | Focus on what matters most |
| **Due Date** | Today, This Week, This Month, Overdue, custom range | Time-based filtering |
| **Defer Date** | Filter by deferred date range | See deferred items |
| **Tags** | Select one or more tags | Cross-project categorization |
| **Search Query** | Free text | Find tasks by name or description |

### Step 2: Save the View

1. Give your view a clear, descriptive **name** (e.g., "This Week's High Priority")
2. Save the view

Your view is now accessible from the **Views** section.

### Step 3: Pin to Sidebar (Optional)

For views you'll use daily:

1. Find the view in your views list
2. Click the **star icon** to pin it
3. The view now appears in your sidebar for one-click access

You can pin multiple views for quick navigation.

## View Recipes: Common Scenarios

Here are ready-to-use view configurations for common work scenarios:

### "Urgent This Week"

Shows only high-priority tasks due within the current week.

- **Priority:** High
- **Due Date:** This Week
- **Use case:** Your daily "what absolutely must get done" list

### "Overdue Items"

Shows everything that's past its due date.

- **Due Date:** Overdue
- **Use case:** Monday morning review — what slipped through the cracks?

### "Waiting on Others"

Shows tasks you've marked with a waiting tag.

- **Tags:** `#waiting` or `#blocked`
- **Use case:** Follow-up list — ping people about blocked items

### "Quick Wins"

Low-effort tasks that can be knocked out fast.

- **Priority:** Low
- **Tags:** `#quick-win`
- **Use case:** When you have 15 minutes between meetings and want to clear some quick items

### "Client Work"

All tasks related to a specific client.

- **Tags:** `#client-acme` (or whatever your client tag convention is)
- **Use case:** Before a client call, see everything related to that client in one place

### "Needs Review"

Tasks waiting for someone to review.

- **Tags:** `#review-needed`
- **Use case:** Reviewers can check this view to see what needs their attention

### "My Assigned Tasks"

Tasks assigned to you across all projects.

- **Search query:** Filter for your name
- **Use case:** See everything on your plate regardless of project

---

## Using Search Within Views

Views support free-text **search queries** that filter tasks by name and description content. Combine search with filters for powerful results:

- **Search:** "budget" + **Priority:** High = All high-priority tasks with "budget" in the name
- **Search:** "review" + **Due:** This Week = All tasks about reviews due this week

Search queries are saved as part of the view, so they run automatically every time you open it.

---

## Managing Your Views

### Editing a View

1. Go to the **Views** section
2. Find the view you want to modify
3. Update its filters, name, or search query
4. Save the changes

### Deleting a View

1. Find the view in your views list
2. Click the **trash icon**
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleted views are removed permanently. If you accidentally delete one, you'll need to recreate it.

### Pinning and Unpinning

- Click the **star icon** to toggle a view's pinned status
- Pinned views appear in your sidebar
- Unpin views you no longer check regularly to keep your sidebar clean

---

## Best Practices

### Keep It Focused

Each view should answer **one question**:

- "What's overdue?" (not "What's overdue and also what's due this week and also what's high priority")
- "What client work is pending?" (not "All my work for every client plus internal work")

If a view gets too broad, split it into multiple focused views.

### Name Clearly

Good names tell you exactly what you'll see:

- "Overdue Tasks" — Clear
- "This Week High Priority" — Clear
- "My View" — Useless
- "Stuff" — Useless

### Review and Prune

Every month, look at your views:

- Are you actually using all of them?
- Are any of them redundant?
- Do any need updated filters?

Delete views you don't use. A cluttered views list is as bad as a cluttered task list.

### Share Configurations with Your Team

While views themselves are personal, you can share the "recipe" with your team:

- "I created a view with Priority=High and Due=This Week — try it!"
- Teams that use the same tags (e.g., `#blocked`, `#review-needed`) benefit most from similar views

## Starter Kit: 3 Views Every Staff Member Should Create

1. **"My Overdue"** — Due: Overdue. Pin it. Check it every morning.
2. **"This Week"** — Due: This Week. Pin it. Use it for weekly planning.
3. **"Blocked"** — Tags: `#blocked` or `#waiting`. Check it twice a week to follow up.

These three views, combined with the Today dashboard, give you complete visibility into your work.
