## What Triggers Notifications?

Tududi sends notifications for events that matter to your work. Here are the notification types:

### Task Notifications

| Event | Who Gets Notified |
|-------|------------------|
| **Task assigned to you** | You (the assignee) |
| **Task unassigned from you** | You (the former assignee) |
| **Assigned task completed** | The person who assigned it |
| **Task due soon** | The task owner and assignee |
| **Task overdue** | The task owner and assignee |
| **Defer until date reached** | The task owner |
| **Task status changed** | Subscribers and assignees |

### Project Notifications

| Event | Who Gets Notified |
|-------|------------------|
| **Project due soon** | Project members |
| **Project overdue** | Project members |

You'll only receive notifications for tasks and projects you own, are assigned to, or have subscribed to. You won't be flooded with notifications about work that doesn't involve you.

## The Notification Center

### Accessing Notifications

Look for the **bell icon** in the top-right area of the screen. If you have unread notifications, you'll see a small number on the icon (e.g., "3") showing how many you haven't read yet.

### Reading Notifications

1. Click the **bell icon** to open the notification dropdown
2. You'll see your most recent notifications (up to 20)
3. Each notification shows:
   - **Title** — What happened (e.g., "Task Assigned")
   - **Message** — Details about the event
   - **Timestamp** — When it occurred
   - **Color indicator** — You don't need to memorize these, they're just visual hints:
     - **Blue** — General information (e.g., a task was updated)
     - **Yellow** — Heads up: a deadline is approaching
     - **Red** — Needs attention: something is overdue
     - **Green** — Good news: something was completed

### Managing Notifications

For each notification, you can:

- **Mark as read** — Click the notification or use the mark-as-read button
- **Dismiss** — Remove it from your list
- **Delete** — Permanently remove it

To clear everything at once, use the **"Mark All as Read"** button at the top of the notification panel.

## Notification Channels

Tududi can reach you through multiple channels. Each can be turned on or off independently:

| Channel | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **In-App** | Notifications appear in the bell icon dropdown within Tududi |
| **Email** | Notifications are sent to your registered email address |
| **Push** | Browser or mobile push notifications |
| **Telegram** | Notifications sent via the Telegram messaging app (optional — most staff don't need this) |

---

## Configuring Your Preferences

This is the most important part of this tutorial. Taking 5 minutes to configure your preferences now will save you from notification fatigue later.

### Accessing Notification Settings

1. Click your **profile picture** at the very bottom of the left sidebar
2. Select **Profile Settings**
3. Click the **Notifications** tab (look for the bell icon in the tab row)

### The Notification Settings Page

You'll see a grid where each row is a type of notification (e.g., "Task Assigned") and each column is a delivery channel (In-App, Email, Push, Telegram). Use the toggles to turn each combination on or off.

### Recommended Starting Configuration

For your first week, keep it simple. You can always adjust later:

**Turn ON email for these (so you never miss them):**
- Task assigned to you
- Task overdue
- Project overdue
- Assigned task completed

**Keep as in-app only (you'll see these when you open Tududi):**
- Task unassigned
- Task due soon
- Project due soon
- Defer until reminder
- Status changes

**Leave OFF for now:**
- Push notifications (except for task overdue, if you want urgent alerts)
- Telegram (unless your admin has set it up)

**The principle:** Start with in-app for everything (it's on by default). Add email only for things you absolutely cannot miss. After a week, adjust based on what you actually need.

## Task Summary Emails

Instead of getting a separate email for every task event, you can receive a single **summary email** — a digest of all your tasks sent at a regular interval. Many staff find this more useful than individual notifications.

### Setting Up Task Summaries

1. Click your **profile picture** at the bottom of the left sidebar, then select **Profile Settings**
2. Find the **Task Summary** section
3. **Enable** task summary emails
4. Choose your **frequency**:

| Frequency | Best For |
|-----------|---------|
| **Daily** | Most staff — one email each morning with your tasks for the day |
| **Weekdays** | Office workers who don't need weekend emails |
| **Weekly** | Light users who check Tududi regularly but want a weekly recap |
| **Every 1-8 hours** | Intensive users who need frequent updates throughout the day |

5. Save your preferences

### Sending a Summary Now

Want to test it? Click the **"Send Now"** button to receive an immediate summary email. This is useful to verify your email is working and to see what the summary looks like.

### What's in a Summary

A task summary email includes:

- Tasks due today
- Overdue tasks
- Tasks assigned to you recently
- Upcoming tasks for the next few days

It's a quick scan you can do from your email inbox without opening Tududi.

## Avoiding Notification Overload

Too many notifications are worse than none — you'll start ignoring all of them. Here's how to stay sane:

### The "Less is More" Approach

1. **Start with in-app only.** For your first week, keep everything to in-app notifications only
2. **Notice what you miss.** After a week, if you missed overdue tasks or assignments, add email for those specific types
3. **Never enable push for everything.** Push notifications should be reserved for truly urgent items only

### Signs You Have Too Many Notifications

- You have 50+ unread notifications regularly
- You click "Mark All as Read" without reading them
- You've started ignoring the bell icon entirely

### What to Do

1. Go to **Notification Settings**
2. Turn off email and push for **low-importance** items (task status changes, defer reminders)
3. Keep email on for **high-importance** items (assignments, overdue alerts)
4. Use the **Task Summary email** instead of individual notifications for day-to-day awareness
