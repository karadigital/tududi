**Audience:** All staff
**When:** Day 1 onboarding
**Time to complete:** 15 minutes

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Create tasks with due dates, priorities, and descriptions
- Use the "Today" flag to plan your day
- Use "Defer Until" to hide tasks you can't act on yet
- Move tasks through their lifecycle statuses
- View upcoming work in multiple ways

---

## Understanding Task Priorities

Priorities help you and your team focus on what matters most. When you have 20 tasks, priorities tell you which ones to tackle first. Use them consistently across your team:

| Priority | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| **No Priority** | Routine work with no urgency |
| **Low** | Should be done eventually, but no rush |
| **Medium** | Important work with a reasonable deadline |
| **High** | Urgent or critical — needs attention today or tomorrow |

### Setting a Priority

1. Open a task by clicking on its name anywhere you see it (Today view, Upcoming, All Tasks, etc.)
2. In the task detail panel that opens on the right side of the screen, find the **Priority** dropdown
3. Select from the options: No Priority / Low / Medium / High
4. The task will be color-coded so you can spot priorities at a glance — gray for Low, yellow for Medium, red for High

## Working with Due Dates

Due dates keep your work on track and help your team understand timelines.

### Adding a Due Date

1. Open a task (click on it, or create a new one)
2. Find the **Due Date** section
3. Click the date picker and select your target date
4. Save the task

### Where Due Dates Appear

Tasks with due dates show up in several places:

- **Today view** — Tasks due today appear in the "Due Today" section
- **Upcoming view** — All future tasks grouped by their due date
- **Calendar view** — Plotted on the day they're due
- **Overdue section** — If you miss a due date, the task appears here prominently

## Task Statuses: The Lifecycle of Work

Every task moves through a series of statuses. Understanding these helps your team know where work stands at a glance.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Not Started** | Task created but work hasn't begun |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **Done** | Work is complete |
| **Waiting** | Blocked — waiting on someone or something else |
| **Archived** | No longer relevant, kept for records |

### Changing a Task's Status

1. Open the task
2. Find the **Status** field
3. Select the appropriate status from the dropdown

**Tip:** Get in the habit of updating status to "In Progress" when you start working on something. This helps your manager and teammates see what's actively being worked on.

## Planning Your Day with the "Today" Flag

Not every task due this week needs your attention *right now*. The **Today** flag lets you cherry-pick what you'll focus on today.

### How to Use It

1. Go to the **All Tasks** or **Upcoming** view
2. Find a task you want to work on today
3. Flag it for today — the task will now appear in your **Today Plan** section on the Today dashboard

### The Daily Planning Routine

Each morning (or the evening before), spend 2-3 minutes:

1. Open the **Today** view
2. Review what's already there (overdue items, tasks due today)
3. Go to **Upcoming** and flag any additional tasks you want to tackle
4. Return to **Today** — your focused plan for the day is ready

## Using "Defer Until" to Hide Tasks You Can't Act On Yet

Sometimes a task exists but you can't work on it right now. Maybe you're waiting for a client to send you a document, or a deliverable isn't needed until next month. The **Defer Until** feature temporarily hides the task from all your views and automatically brings it back on a date you choose. This keeps your task list focused on what you can actually act on today.

### Setting a Defer Date

1. Open the task
2. Find the **Defer Until** section
3. Pick the date when you want this task to reappear
4. Save the task

The task vanishes from your active views and reappears automatically on the deferred date. This keeps your task list clean and focused on what's actually actionable.

### When to Use Defer

- "I can't start this until the client sends the brief" — defer until the expected delivery date
- "This is a reminder for next month's review" — defer until a few days before
- "I need to follow up if I don't hear back by Friday" — defer until Friday

**Note:** If a task has both a due date and a defer date, you'll see a warning if the defer date is after the due date — that would mean the task appears after it's already overdue.

---

## Adding Descriptions to Tasks

Tasks aren't just titles. Use the **task description** field to add context that helps you (or whoever the task is assigned to) understand what needs to be done.

> **Note:** "Task descriptions" are different from "Project Notes" (which you'll learn about in Tutorial 3). A task description is the detail text on a single task. A Project Note is a separate document attached to a project.

### Writing a Task Description

1. Open the task by clicking on its name
2. In the task detail panel, find the **text area below the task name** — this is the description field
3. You can switch between **Edit** mode (where you type) and **Preview** mode (where you see the formatted result)
4. Write your description. You can use simple formatting:
   - Surround text with double asterisks for **bold** (e.g., type `**important**` to get **important**)
   - Start a line with a dash and space for bullet points (e.g., `- item one`)
5. Save the task

### What to Include in a Description

- **Context:** Why does this task exist?
- **Acceptance criteria:** How do we know it's done?
- **Links:** References to documents, tickets, or resources
- **Notes:** Any relevant details or constraints

## Navigating Your Work: Key Views

Tududi gives you several ways to look at your tasks. Each view serves a different purpose.

### Today

Your **home base**. Shows overdue tasks, tasks due today, your manually planned items, and completed tasks. Start and end your day here.

### Upcoming

A **forward-looking** view. Tasks are grouped by due date so you can see what's coming in the next days and weeks. Use this for weekly planning.

### All Tasks

The **complete list**. Every task you have access to, with filtering and sorting options:

- **Filter by status:** Active, Completed, or All
- **Sort by:** Status, Created date, Due date, or Priority
- **Group by:** None, Status, or Assignee
- **Search:** Type to filter by task name

### Calendar

A **visual timeline**. Toggle between:

- **Month view** — See task distribution across the month
- **Week view** — See tasks in hourly slots for the week
- **Day view** — Detailed daily schedule

Use the **arrow buttons** to navigate between periods and the **Today** button to jump back to the current date.

## Putting It All Together: A Day in Tududi

Here's what a productive daily workflow looks like:

### Morning (2-3 minutes)

1. Open Tududi and go to **Today**
2. Review any **overdue** tasks — reschedule or complete them
3. Scan **Due Today** — these are your hard commitments
4. Open **Upcoming** and flag 2-3 additional tasks for today
5. Return to **Today** — your focused plan is ready

### During the Day

1. Work through tasks in your **Today Plan**
2. Update statuses to **In Progress** as you start each task
3. Mark tasks **Done** as you finish them
4. Watch your **progress bar** fill up

### End of Day (1-2 minutes)

1. Check your **Today** view — anything left undone?
2. Reschedule or defer unfinished tasks
3. Quickly scan **Upcoming** for tomorrow's priorities

## Quick Tips

- **Be specific with task names.** "Update report" is vague. "Update Q1 sales report with January figures" is actionable.
- **Don't over-plan.** Flag 3-5 tasks for today, not 20. You can always add more.
- **Use Waiting status.** If you're blocked, mark it as Waiting so you don't keep looking at something you can't act on.
- **Defer liberally.** If it's not actionable this week, defer it. A shorter task list is a more useful one.
