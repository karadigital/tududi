## Task Assignment

Task assignment is how work gets distributed in Tududi. When you assign a task to someone, you're saying: "This is your responsibility to complete."

### Assigning a Task to a Colleague

1. Open the task (click on it, or create a new one)
2. Find the **Assignee** section
3. Click the dropdown to see a searchable list of users
4. Select the person you want to assign the task to
5. Save the task

The assignee is now responsible for the task. They'll be notified immediately (see Tutorial 5 for notification details).

### What Happens When You Assign a Task

When you assign a task to someone:

- The **assignee receives a notification** that a task has been assigned to them
- The assignee **can immediately edit the task** — they can update the status, add details, and mark it complete
- The task appears in the **assignee's task views** (Today, Upcoming, All Tasks)
- **You remain the owner** of the task — assignment doesn't transfer ownership

### What Happens When You Are Assigned a Task

When someone assigns a task to you:

- You receive a **notification** (in-app, email, or other channels based on your preferences)
- The task appears in your **All Tasks** view and in **Today/Upcoming** if it has a due date
- You can edit the task, update its status, and mark it complete
- When you complete the task, the **person who assigned it gets notified**

### Reassigning and Unassigning

- To **reassign**, open the task and select a different person from the Assignee dropdown
- To **unassign**, clear the assignee field — the task returns to being unassigned

## Project Sharing

While task assignment handles individual work items, **Project sharing** gives colleagues access to an entire Project and all its tasks.

### Sharing a Project

1. Open the Project you want to share by clicking its name in the sidebar
2. Look for the **Share** button or gear/settings icon on the project page
3. Search for and select the colleague you want to share with
4. Choose the **permission level**:

| Permission | What They Can Do | When to Use |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Read** | View the project and its tasks, but cannot make changes | When someone needs to see progress but doesn't do the work (e.g., a stakeholder or your manager) |
| **Read-Write** | View, create, edit, and complete tasks within the project | When someone will actively work on the project with you |

5. Confirm the share

### When to Share a Project

- **Cross-team collaboration** — A marketing campaign that needs input from the design team
- **Manager visibility** — Share with your manager so they can monitor progress
- **Temporary contributors** — A consultant helping on a specific initiative
- **Stakeholder visibility** — Give read-only access to people who need to track progress but don't do the work

### Viewing Shared Projects

Projects shared with you appear in your sidebar alongside your own projects. There's no visual difference in navigation — they integrate seamlessly into your workspace.

### Removing Access

If someone no longer needs access to a project:

1. Open the Project's sharing settings
2. Find the person in the shared list
3. Remove their access

They will immediately lose visibility into the Project and its tasks.

## Task Subscriptions: Monitoring Without Owning

There are two ways to stay connected to a task:

1. **Being assigned** — You're responsible for doing the work
2. **Subscribing** — You just want to be notified when the task changes, but you're not the one doing it

Subscriptions are perfect when you need awareness without responsibility.

### Subscribing to a Task

1. Open the task you want to monitor by clicking its name
2. Click the **Subscribe** button
3. You'll now receive notifications when the task's status changes, when it's completed, or when it's updated

### When to Use Subscriptions

- You've **asked someone else to do a task** and want to know when it's done
- A task in another team **affects your work** and you need to know when it's complete
- You're a **stakeholder** who needs to track progress but you're not the one doing the work

### Unsubscribing

If you no longer need updates:

1. Open the task
2. Click **Unsubscribe**

## Area Memberships

Areas (your department groupings from Tutorial 3) also control who can see what. Your administrator manages Area memberships — you typically don't need to change these yourself.

### Understanding Area Roles

| Role | What You Can Do |
|------|----------------|
| **Member** | View the Area, see its Projects, and work on tasks you've been given access to |
| **Admin** | Everything a Member can do, plus: manage Area settings, add/remove members, and create new Projects |

If you need access to an Area you can't see, contact your administrator or Area admin.

## Understanding Who Can See What

You don't need to memorize the permission system, but it helps to understand the basics so you know what your colleagues can and can't see.

### The Simple Version

- **You created it?** You have full control over it.
- **You were assigned a task?** You can edit and complete that specific task.
- **A project was shared with you?** You can see everything in that project (and edit it, if you were given Read-Write access).
- **You're a member of an Area?** You can see the projects in that Area.

### How Access Flows

- If someone shares a **Project** with you, you can see all the tasks inside it
- If someone assigns you a **single task**, you can work on that task even if you don't have access to the rest of the project
- Being a member of an **Area** gives you visibility into that department's projects

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### Communication Etiquette

- **Assign, don't surprise.** If a task requires significant effort, discuss it with the person before assigning — don't just drop a big task on them
- **Add context.** When assigning a task, include a clear description of what's expected and any relevant deadlines
- **Update statuses.** Keep your task statuses current so your team knows where things stand
- **Use Waiting status.** If you're blocked, set the status to Waiting and note why in the description — don't leave teammates guessing

### Keeping Projects Organized

- **One owner per Project.** Even shared Projects should have a clear owner who keeps things tidy
- **Consistent naming.** Agree on naming conventions for tasks (e.g., start with a verb: "Write...", "Review...", "Design...")
- **Regular cleanup.** Archive completed tasks periodically. A Project with 200 open tasks is overwhelming

### Respecting Boundaries

- **Don't reassign others' tasks** without discussing it first
- **Don't edit shared task descriptions** without flagging the change — add a comment or update the description clearly
- **Check before sharing.** Some Projects may contain sensitive information — confirm with the owner before sharing with additional people

## Common Workflows

### Delegating Work

1. Create the task with a clear description and due date
2. Assign it to the appropriate person
3. Subscribe to the task so you get notified when it's done
4. The assignee works on it, updating status as they go
5. When they complete it, you receive a notification

### Requesting Help from Another Team

1. Identify the task that needs cross-team help
2. Ask the other team's lead to share their Project with you, or assign the task directly
3. Use Tags (e.g., `#cross-team`, `#design-request`) to mark cross-team tasks
4. Set a clear due date and priority so the other team can prioritize it

### Running a Team Meeting

1. Open your Project by clicking its name in the sidebar
2. In the task list, find the sorting/grouping controls at the top and choose **Group by: Assignee** — this splits the task list into sections, one per team member
3. Choose **Sort by: Status** to see In Progress and Blocked items first
4. Review **overdue tasks** as a team and agree on new dates
5. Create new tasks for action items from the meeting and assign them on the spot
