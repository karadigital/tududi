## Task Assignment

Task assignment is how work gets distributed in Tududi. When you assign a task to someone, you're saying: "This is your responsibility to complete."

### Assigning a Task to a Colleague

1. Open the task (click on it, or create a new one)
2. Find the **Assignee** section
3. Click the dropdown to see a searchable list of users
4. Select the person you want to assign the task to
5. Save the task

The assignee is now responsible for the task. They'll be notified immediately (see Tutorial 5 for notification details).

### What Happens When You Assign a Task

When you assign a task to someone:

- The **assignee receives a notification** that a task has been assigned to them
- The assignee **automatically gets write access** to the task — they can edit, update status, and complete it
- The task appears in the **assignee's task views** (Today, Upcoming, All Tasks)
- **You remain the owner** of the task — assignment doesn't transfer ownership

### What Happens When You Are Assigned a Task

When someone assigns a task to you:

- You receive a **notification** (in-app, email, or other channels based on your preferences)
- The task appears in your **All Tasks** view and in **Today/Upcoming** if it has a due date
- You can edit the task, update its status, and mark it complete
- When you complete the task, the **person who assigned it gets notified**

### Reassigning and Unassigning

- To **reassign**, open the task and select a different person from the Assignee dropdown
- To **unassign**, clear the assignee field — the task returns to being unassigned

## Project Sharing

While task assignment handles individual work items, **Project sharing** gives colleagues access to an entire Project and all its tasks.

### Sharing a Project

1. Open the Project you want to share
2. Look for the **sharing or permissions settings**
3. Search for and select the colleague you want to share with
4. Choose the **permission level**:

| Permission | What They Can Do |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Read** | View the project and its tasks, but cannot edit |
| **Read-Write** | View, create, edit, and complete tasks within the project |

5. Confirm the share

### When to Share a Project

- **Cross-team collaboration** — A marketing campaign that needs input from the design team
- **Manager visibility** — Share with your manager so they can monitor progress
- **Temporary contributors** — A consultant helping on a specific initiative
- **Stakeholder visibility** — Give read-only access to people who need to track progress but don't do the work

### Viewing Shared Projects

Projects shared with you appear in your sidebar alongside your own projects. There's no visual difference in navigation — they integrate seamlessly into your workspace.

### Removing Access

If someone no longer needs access to a project:

1. Open the Project's sharing settings
2. Find the person in the shared list
3. Remove their access

They will immediately lose visibility into the Project and its tasks.

## Task Subscriptions

Sometimes you don't own or work on a task, but you need to stay informed about its progress. That's what **subscriptions** are for.

### Subscribing to a Task

1. Open the task you want to monitor
2. Click the **Subscribe** button
3. You'll now receive notifications when the task is updated

### When to Use Subscriptions

- You've **delegated** a task and want to know when it's done
- A task in another team **blocks your work** and you want to know when it's complete
- You're a **stakeholder** who needs to track progress without being the assignee

### Unsubscribing

If you no longer need updates:

1. Open the task
2. Click **Unsubscribe**

## Area Memberships

Areas (departments) have their own membership system that controls who can see and interact with the Area's projects.

### Understanding Area Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Member** | Can view the Area, see its Projects, and work on tasks within shared Projects |
| **Admin** | Everything a Member can do, plus: manage Area settings, add/remove members, create Projects |

Your Area membership is typically set up by your administrator or Area admin. If you need access to an Area you can't see, contact your administrator.

## The Permission System

Tududi has a layered permission system. Understanding it helps you know who can see and do what.

### How Permissions Work

1. **Ownership** — You always have full control over tasks and projects you created
2. **Assignment** — When you're assigned a task, you automatically get write access to it
3. **Project sharing** — Shared projects grant the specified level of access to all tasks within
4. **Area membership** — Being a member of an Area gives you access to its Projects (based on sharing settings)

### Permission Inheritance

Permissions can cascade:

- A **Project shared** with you gives you access to all tasks in that Project
- **Task assignment** gives you access to that specific task even if you don't have access to the broader Project
- **Area membership** gives you visibility into the Area's Projects

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### Communication Etiquette

- **Assign, don't surprise.** If a task requires significant effort, discuss it with the person before assigning — don't just drop a big task on them
- **Add context.** When assigning a task, include a clear description of what's expected and any relevant deadlines
- **Update statuses.** Keep your task statuses current so your team knows where things stand
- **Use Waiting status.** If you're blocked, set the status to Waiting and note why in the description — don't leave teammates guessing

### Keeping Projects Organized

- **One owner per Project.** Even shared Projects should have a clear owner who keeps things tidy
- **Consistent naming.** Agree on naming conventions for tasks (e.g., start with a verb: "Write...", "Review...", "Design...")
- **Regular cleanup.** Archive completed tasks periodically. A Project with 200 open tasks is overwhelming

### Respecting Boundaries

- **Don't reassign others' tasks** without discussing it first
- **Don't edit shared task descriptions** without flagging the change — add a comment or update the description clearly
- **Check before sharing.** Some Projects may contain sensitive information — confirm with the owner before sharing with additional people

## Common Workflows

### Delegating Work

1. Create the task with a clear description and due date
2. Assign it to the appropriate person
3. Subscribe to the task so you get notified when it's done
4. The assignee works on it, updating status as they go
5. When they complete it, you receive a notification

### Requesting Help from Another Team

1. Identify the task that needs cross-team help
2. Ask the other team's lead to share their Project with you, or assign the task directly
3. Use Tags (e.g., `#cross-team`, `#design-request`) to mark cross-team tasks
4. Set a clear due date and priority so the other team can prioritize it

### Running a Team Meeting

1. Open your Project
2. Use **Group by: Assignee** to see who's working on what
3. Use **Sort by: Status** to focus on In Progress and Blocked items
4. Review **overdue tasks** and agree on new dates
5. Create new tasks for action items from the meeting and assign them on the spot
