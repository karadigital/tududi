## Your Role as a Manager in Tududi

As a manager, you use Tududi differently from individual contributors. Your focus is on:

- **Visibility** — Knowing what your team is working on and where things stand
- **Accountability** — Ensuring tasks are progressing and nothing is falling through the cracks
- **Planning** — Understanding capacity and distributing work effectively
- **Communication** — Using Tududi's tools to reduce status meetings and email chains

You don't need to micromanage individual tasks. Instead, use the tools below to maintain healthy oversight.

## Monitoring Team Tasks

### Viewing Assigned Tasks Across Your Team

To see what your team is working on:

1. Open a **Project** that your team works on
2. Use the **Group by: Assignee** option
3. This reorganizes the task list into sections, one per team member

Now you can see at a glance:

- **Who has the most tasks** — potential overload
- **Who has few tasks** — potential capacity
- **Which tasks are In Progress** — what's actively being worked on
- **Which tasks are blocked or waiting** — where to intervene

### Using the Assignee Filter

In any task list view (Project, All Tasks, or custom Views), use the **Assignee filter dropdown** to see tasks for a specific person:

1. Click the assignee filter
2. Select a team member
3. The view shows only their tasks

This is useful for one-on-one meetings — quickly pull up everything assigned to that person.

### Creating a Manager View

Build a custom View (see Tutorial 8) specifically for management:

**"Team Overdue"**
- Due: Overdue
- Pin to sidebar
- Check daily — these are the items slipping through the cracks

**"High Priority This Week"**
- Priority: High
- Due: This Week
- Pin to sidebar
- Use for prioritization decisions

**"Blocked Items"**
- Tags: `#blocked` or `#waiting`
- Check twice weekly — these are the items that need your intervention to unblock

## Tracking Project Health

### Project States at a Glance

Every project has a state. As a manager, your job is to ensure these states are accurate and that blocked or stalled projects get attention.

| State | What It Tells You | Your Action |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Idea** | Under consideration, not yet approved | Review and decide: promote to Planned or discard |
| **Planned** | Approved, work hasn't started yet | Ensure resources are allocated and a start date is clear |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on | Monitor task completion rate and blockers |
| **Blocked** | Stalled on a dependency | Investigate and unblock — this is where managers add the most value |
| **Completed** | All work is done | Review, celebrate, and archive |

### Project Metrics Panel

When you open a Project, the metrics panel gives you a quick health check:

- **Total tasks** — How big is this initiative?
- **Completed tasks** — What percentage is done?
- **Overdue tasks** — Are we falling behind?
- **In Progress tasks** — Is work actively happening?

A healthy project has a growing completed count, few overdue items, and a steady stream of in-progress work. Red flags include:

- Many overdue tasks
- No in-progress tasks (stalled)
- All tasks are "Not Started" weeks after kickoff

### Pinning Key Projects

Pin your most critical projects to the sidebar so they're always one click away:

1. Find the project in your sidebar
2. Click the **pin icon**
3. The project moves to the top of your Projects section

You can pin up to **5 projects**. Use these slots for:

- Projects with tight deadlines
- Projects in Blocked state that need attention
- High-visibility initiatives that leadership asks about

---

## Understanding Team Workload

### Sorting and Grouping Options

When viewing tasks within a project or across All Tasks:

**Sort by Due Date** to see what's coming next:
- Tasks due soonest appear first
- Quickly spot deadline clusters (too much due on the same day?)

**Sort by Priority** to focus energy:
- High priority items first
- Ensure high-priority items have clear owners and due dates

**Group by Status** to see workflow distribution:
- How many tasks are Not Started vs. In Progress vs. Done?
- A healthy distribution has most tasks flowing through In Progress to Done
- Too many tasks stuck in Not Started = team may be blocked or overwhelmed

**Group by Assignee** to check distribution:
- Is work evenly distributed?
- Is one person overloaded while another has capacity?

### Signs of Workload Problems

| Signal | What It Means | Your Response |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| One person has 20+ active tasks | Overloaded | Redistribute, reprioritize, or defer |
| Many tasks are "Not Started" for weeks | Stalled or unclear | Check if requirements are clear; check for blockers |
| Many tasks overdue for same person | Capacity issue | One-on-one to understand constraints; adjust deadlines |
| No tasks in "In Progress" | Nobody is working | Investigate — is the team blocked? Do they know what to pick up next? |
| All tasks assigned to one person | Single point of failure | Cross-train, delegate, distribute |

## Staying Informed Without Micromanaging

### Notification Strategy for Managers

Configure your notifications to get the signals you need without drowning in noise:

**Recommended Settings:**

| Notification Type | In-App | Email | Why |
|-------------------|--------|-------|-----|
| Assigned task completed | On | On | Know when delegated work is done |
| Task overdue | On | On | Catch missed deadlines early |
| Project overdue | On | On | Project-level deadline awareness |
| Task assigned | On | Off | Know about new assignments in your projects |
| Status changes | On | Off | Track progress without checking constantly |

**Not recommended for managers:**
- Push notifications for everything — save push for truly critical alerts
- Email for status changes — too noisy; check in-app instead

### Task Summary Emails

Set up a **daily** or **weekday** Task Summary email (Profile Settings > Task Summary):

- Get a morning digest of tasks due today, overdue items, and recent assignments
- Scan it in 60 seconds with your morning coffee
- No need to log into Tududi to get a pulse check

### Subscriptions for Key Tasks

For tasks that are critical but assigned to others:

1. Open the task
2. Click **Subscribe**
3. You'll get notified on status changes without being the assignee

Use this for:
- Client-facing deliverables
- Tasks blocking other teams
- Items that leadership is asking about

## Running Team Meetings with Tududi

### Weekly Team Standup

Instead of going around the room asking "What are you working on?", use Tududi:

1. Open the main **Project** for your team
2. **Group by: Assignee**
3. Walk through each person's section:
   - What's **In Progress**? (What are you working on now?)
   - What's **Blocked**? (Where do you need help?)
   - What's **Overdue**? (What needs re-prioritization?)
4. Create new tasks for action items during the meeting and assign them on the spot

This cuts meeting time because everyone can see the status before the meeting starts.

### One-on-One Meetings

1. Use the **Assignee filter** to see only this person's tasks
2. Review:
   - Completed tasks since last meeting — celebrate wins
   - In-progress tasks — any blockers?
   - Upcoming tasks — capacity check
   - Overdue tasks — what happened? Adjust deadlines if needed
3. Create follow-up tasks together and assign them during the meeting

### Project Review

1. Open the Project
2. Check the **metrics panel** — overall health
3. Review **project state** — is it accurate?
4. Look at the **task list sorted by due date** — any upcoming deadline clusters?
5. Check **overdue tasks** — need action?
6. Update the project state if needed

---

## Delegation Best Practices

### Assigning Work Effectively

1. **Clear task name** — Start with a verb: "Write...", "Review...", "Schedule..."
2. **Description with context** — Why does this task exist? What does "done" look like?
3. **Realistic due date** — Discuss with the assignee; don't impose arbitrary deadlines
4. **Appropriate priority** — Not everything is High priority; be honest about urgency
5. **Right project** — Put the task in the correct project so it has organizational context

### Follow-Up Without Hovering

- **Don't** open tasks daily to check if they're done — that's what notifications are for
- **Do** subscribe to critical tasks and let notifications come to you
- **Do** check your "Team Overdue" custom view 2-3 times per week
- **Do** bring up blockers proactively in standups
- **Don't** reassign or reprioritize tasks without discussing with the assignee first

### When Things Fall Behind

1. **Start with curiosity, not blame.** Check the task event timeline — what's the history? Were there scope changes, blocks, or dependencies?
2. **Look for patterns.** If one person is consistently overdue, it's likely a workload issue, not a motivation issue
3. **Adjust the system, not just the person.** Maybe priorities need rebalancing, or work needs redistribution
4. **Use Defer Until.** If a task can't be done now, defer it to a realistic date rather than leaving it overdue

## Building a Management Dashboard

Combine what you've learned to build a complete management view:

### Pinned Projects (Sidebar)

- Pin your 3-5 most important active projects
- Check each one briefly every morning

### Custom Views (Pinned to Sidebar)

1. **"Team Overdue"** — Due: Overdue — Check daily
2. **"This Week Critical"** — Priority: High, Due: This Week — Check daily
3. **"Blocked"** — Tags: `#blocked` — Check 2-3 times per week

### Daily Routine (5 minutes)

1. Read your **Task Summary email** over coffee
2. Open **Today** — check your own tasks
3. Glance at **"Team Overdue"** view — any new overdue items?
4. Check **pinned projects** — any state changes or new blockers?

### Weekly Routine (15 minutes)

1. Open each pinned Project → review metrics and progress
2. Check **"Blocked"** view → follow up on stuck items
3. Review team workload → Group by Assignee in your main project
4. Prepare for team standup using the views above
