## What Is the Inbox?

The Inbox is Tududi's **quick capture** tool. It's designed for one purpose: **get the idea out of your head and into the system as fast as possible**, so you can deal with it later without losing your current focus.

Think of it as a notepad that sits between "random thought" and "organized task."

### Why Use the Inbox?

- You're in a meeting and someone mentions something you need to follow up on
- You remember a task while working on something else and don't want to lose context
- You have a vague idea that needs more thought before it becomes a proper task
- You receive an email that requires action but you can't deal with it right now

The key principle: **capture now, organize later.**

## Capturing Items

### Quick Capture

1. Navigate to the **Inbox** section
2. You'll see a text input area for quick capture
3. Type your thought — it doesn't need to be a perfectly formed task
4. Press **Enter** or click **Save**

That's it. The item is saved. You can come back to organize it later.

### Examples of Good Inbox Captures

```
Follow up with Sarah about the Q2 budget numbers
```

```
Research competitors' pricing pages for the redesign
```

```
Ask IT about VPN access for the new contractor
```

```
Idea: weekly team lunch rotation to improve morale
```

Notice these are informal, quick, and don't require you to decide on priority, due date, or project. That's the point.

## Shorthand Syntax

Tududi's Inbox understands special characters that automatically categorize your items:

### Tags with #

Add hashtags to auto-tag your item:

```
Review the contract draft #legal #urgent
```

This creates an inbox item tagged with `legal` and `urgent`. When you later convert it to a task, those tags carry over.

### Projects with +

Reference a project with the + symbol:

```
Update landing page copy +Website Redesign
```

This associates the item with the "Website Redesign" project. The system will search your existing projects and match it.

### Combined Example

```
Schedule client demo for next week #client-acme +Q1 Sales Push #high-priority
```

This captures an item tagged with `client-acme` and `high-priority`, associated with the "Q1 Sales Push" project.

## AI-Assisted Categorization

When you save an inbox item, Tududi can analyze the text and suggest:

- **Whether it's a Task or a Note** — Action items are suggested as tasks; reference information is suggested as notes
- **Suggested tags** — Based on the content
- **Suggested project** — If the content matches an existing project

These are suggestions only — you make the final decision when processing the item.

## Processing Your Inbox

Capturing items is only half the workflow. The other half is **processing** — turning raw captures into organized work.

### How to Process an Item

1. Go to your **Inbox**
2. Click on an item to open it
3. Choose what to do with it:

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|------------|
| **Convert to Task** | It's an actionable item — something that needs to be done |
| **Convert to Note** | It's reference information, an idea to document, or meeting notes |
| **Edit and Refine** | The item needs more detail before you can categorize it |
| **Delete** | On reflection, it's not needed |

### Converting to a Task

When you convert an inbox item to a task:

1. Click **Convert to Task**
2. A task creation form appears, pre-filled with:
   - The inbox item text as the task name
   - Any parsed tags already applied
   - Any suggested project already selected
3. Add additional details: priority, due date, assignee
4. Save the task
5. The inbox item is marked as **processed**

### Converting to a Note

When the item is more informational than actionable:

1. Click **Convert to Note**
2. A note creation form appears with the content pre-filled
3. Assign it to a project, add a color, and add tags
4. Save the note

### Inbox Item Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Added** | New item, not yet reviewed |
| **Processed** | Converted to a task, note, or project |
| **Archived** | Reviewed but no action needed |

---

## Save Mode: Skip the Inbox

If you already know what an item is when you're capturing it, you can skip the inbox step entirely:

- **Save as Inbox Item** (default) — Goes to inbox for later processing
- **Save as Task** — Creates a task immediately
- **Save as Note** — Creates a note immediately

Use the save mode selector when capturing to choose. Default to "Inbox Item" when you're in a hurry and want to decide later.

## Building the Inbox Review Habit

The Inbox is only useful if you process it regularly. An overflowing inbox is just another source of stress.

### The Daily 2-Minute Review

Add this to your morning routine (right after checking your Today view):

1. Open the **Inbox**
2. Go through each unprocessed item, one by one
3. For each item, make a quick decision:
   - **Task?** Convert it, assign priority and due date
   - **Note?** Convert it, attach to a project
   - **Not needed?** Delete it
   - **Not sure yet?** Leave it for tomorrow (but don't leave things more than 2-3 days)
4. Aim for **Inbox Zero** — an empty inbox means everything has been captured and categorized

### Tips for Effective Inbox Processing

- **Don't overthink it.** The first 2-minute review is about quick decisions, not perfect organization
- **Use "Low Priority" liberally.** If you're not sure how urgent something is, make it a Low Priority task. You can always change it later.
- **Batch similar items.** If you captured 5 items for the same project, process them back-to-back
- **Delete without guilt.** Not every idea deserves to become a task. If it's not worth doing, delete it.

## Inbox vs. Direct Task Creation

When should you use the Inbox vs. creating a task directly?

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| In a meeting, quick capture needed | **Inbox** |
| You know the exact project, priority, and due date | **Direct task creation** (Ctrl+Shift+T) |
| Vague idea that needs refinement | **Inbox** |
| Assigned a clear action item by your manager | **Direct task creation** |
| Brainstorming session, lots of quick ideas | **Inbox** (rapid fire) |
| Single well-defined task | **Direct task creation** |
